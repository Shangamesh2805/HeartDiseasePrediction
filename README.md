# Heart Disease Prediction

In this we have predicted the heart disease of comman people with Machine Learning Model Algorithm are explained below

We have used :
1. **SVM**
2. **Naive Bayes**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **LightGBM**
7. **XGboost**
these model to comapre their results. And on average we have got the result of more than 85%. 

Dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

And we have also deployed the Machine Learning model in Real-Time Website using Flask
