# Heart Disease Prediction

In this model we have predicted the risk of heart disease based on real dataset that we got from a medical university chennai.

**DATASET**
  The dataset we used contians more than 150 patient records and their daily routine data.
  As a result it helps  our model to train with realtime data.Our data set contains many features like age,Dietary hahbit,Alcohol consumer or not etc...
  
 **Data Preprocessing:**
    We have preprocessed our dataset using Sk-learn.
    ***sk-learn:***
          The sklearn.preprocessing package provides several common utility functions and transformer classes to change raw feature vectors into a representation that       is more suitable for the downstream estimators. In general, learning algorithms benefit from standardization of the data set.
          
**Models Used:**          
          
1. **SVM**
2. **Naive Bayes**
3. **Logistic Regression**
4. **Decision Tree**
5. **Random Forest**
6. **LightGBM**
7. **XGboost**

**Model's Result Prediction Percentage:**
**SVM:**
    Support Vector Machine
    
        ~Training Set Prediction : 0.6694214876033058
        
        ~Testing Set Prediction : 0.5737704918032787
    
**Naive Bayes:**
    Works based on Naive Bayes algorithm
    
        ~Training Set Prediction :0.8677685950413223
        
        ~Testing Set Prediction :  0.7868852459016393
    
these model to comapre their results. And on average we have got the result of more than 85%.
